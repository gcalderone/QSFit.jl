**QSFit** (Quasar Spectral Fitting) is a software package to automatically perform the analysis of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSO) optical/IR spectra. The software provides luminosity estimates for the non-thermal continuum, the Balmer continuum, both optical and UV iron blended complex, host galaxy and emission lines, as well as width, velocity offset and equivalent width of several emission lines.  The ultimate purpose of **QSFit** is to allow astronomers to run standardized recipes to analyze the AGN/QSO spectral data in a simple, replicable and shareable way. The whole fitting process is customizable for specific needs, and can be extended to analyze spectra from other data sources.


> [!NOTE]
> This package is the Julia porting of the [old QSFit code](https://github.com/gcalderone/qsfit) written in IDL.
